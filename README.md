Problem Statement
There are some problem statements that need to be considered in developing our recycling machine. First, there is less awareness toward recycling the used materials such as plastic bottles. Besides, there are very few machines to recycle these plastic bottles in Turkey. Although there are some machines used abroad to recycle used plastic bottles, Turkey is not yet widely applied.Thus, we were inspired by the machines used abroad to make plastic recycling widespread also in Turkey.
So ,as an incentive, it was determined that the machine would be paid to the person in return for recycling.In addition, a component has been added that determines that the machine will only accept bottles with barcodes so that the public does not throw any other material (such as glass, etc.) other than the bottle.
Finally, we think that individuals who are not aware of plastic bottles recycling also waste water.It has been determined that most individuals in Turkey are unaware of the information that if there is water in the plastic bottle recycling bottle, it will not be recycled.Therefore, when a bottle is placed in the machine, a component has been added that detects whether there is water in the machine.
As a result, the development of plastic bottle recycling machines is on the right track in other countries and we argue that our machine should be implemented in Turkey as soon as possible in order to raise awareness about the importance of recycling materials, especially plastic.

Description of System Functionalities & Users
You will encounter a screen when starting to use the machine. After the card is read, if your card information is valid, you can see your id number. You will place the bottle in the machine's chamber without any action for the bottle you will throw. The machine takes the bottle and checks whether there is water or not with its sensor with barcode reading. If the given product is valid, the bottles are added to the bottle tank, and if the supplied water is valid, they are added to the water tank. If the product given according to the barcode number is not valid, the product is returned to the user and the process is terminated. If the stages progress correctly, the balance is loaded as much as the bottle added by the user. The user receives this balance by choosing one of the options as donation or pay to card. If he chooses to donate, monthly donations are given to charities. If the card is paid,
the user can use the card in certain places. The user is informed at first that the water he added is given to the municipality for irrigation in the parks.
